		This project aims to develop touch-based visualisations in three-dimensions and will focus on using large data in a generic way to demonstrate general applicability. The visualisations will provide touch-capability so they are able to be viewed on a smart device.}

	\section{Project plan} {
	\label{sec:project_plan}
		
		This project will be developed in a web environment to ensure the creation of a platform independent system. It will primarily use \href{http://threejs.org/}{Three.js}, a JavaScript library that abstracts WebGL, as a tool for creating 3D visualisations. The main \emph{goals} of this project are to:
		
		%\begin{multicols}{2}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Visualise big data in a time efficient manner. 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This should be a reasonable loading time for the user.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Apply the visualisations to multiple datasets and ensure they are scalable. 
			\item Integrate the results into the group project.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Apply the visualisations in different ways.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Learn how 3D visualisations can effectively convey information.
			\item Learn how to optimise calls and understand what drains processing resources easily.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This can be measured with a \href{http://jsperf.com/}{JavaScript performance testing environment}.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		%\end{multicols}
		
		To facilitate these goals, this project will involve creating visualisations that are able to compared with one another. This will be done so it can be seen which visualisation is more effective at representing a dataset in particular applications. With this in mind, it has been decided that heat maps will be used as the basis of this project as they have a wide array of applications. Figure~\ref{fig:heat_maps} features two different ways of visualising a heat map. It has potential applications in displaying a 3D column or bar chart, financial and geographical data. It is interesting to note that geographical data can be applied to both visualisations, where the image on the left can be mapped to a sphere and could represent population data, while the other could represent pollution levels in a city.

	        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}

	        \end{subfigure}
			\caption{Two different representations of a heat map. \citep{tuomainen2014financial} \citep{fuchs2006physiological}}
			\label{fig:heat_maps}
		\end{figure}
		
		The data for the visualisations can easily be represented as a flat array. It may or may not need to be preprocessed, as this depends on the format of the data. This data representation has also been adopted by \href{https://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe}{The WebGL Globe} Chrome Experiment, as shown in Appendix~\ref{app:globe}, is a great example of visualising big data in an efficient way. This open platform project clearly demonstrates that the goals of this project are achievable. They encourage users to use their own datasets, ensuring a certain level of scalability and applications with geographical data.
		
		The development of these visualisations will involve using the established \href{http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Extras.Geometries/BoxGeometry}{BoxGeometry} and NURBS surface that are available in Three.js. The \href{http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_geometry_nurbs.html}{NURBS example}, as displayed in Appendix~\ref{app:nurbs}, proves that it is possible to render a smooth 3D surface. This can be applied to represent a heat map and if there lie difficulties in implementing this, then an simpler representation can be modelled.

	\section{Project schedule} {
	\label{sec:project_schedule}
	
		The project plan, which was outlined in Section~\ref{sec:project_plan}, is to be completed according to the project schedule. This has been demonstrated through the Gantt chart in Figure~\ref{gantt:schedule} below, and clearly highlights each milestone that is critical to the success of this project. These include:
		
		\begin{description}
			\item[Progress reports:] Progress update meetings have been scheduled with the project supervisor on a fortnightly basis.
			\item[Individual research presentation:] The presentation requires written preparation and rehearsal. It should be completed by the end of the first week so more important tasks can be focused on.
			\item[Final report:] This report encompasses the deliverables of the project as they form the basis for the documentation. The report will need to be allocated at least one fortnight after the deliverables have been completed, so it can be completed to a good standard of quality.
			\begin{description}
				\item[Basic deliverables:] This should be completed in two weeks and consists of the implementation for a single visualisation and interactions for panning, zooming and rotating.
				\item[Intermediate deliverables:] These deliverables have been designated one month to complete. It includes the ability to filter data, apply the visualisation to one or more large datasets and the implementation of another visualisation.
				\item[Advanced deliverables:] This has also been allotted one month to complete and it is a core requirement to integrate the data to the group project. Analysing the computational power and the scalability of the visualisations are considered to be more important than the other tasks and thus have been allocated more time.
			\end{description}
		\end{description}
		
		Unfortunately, it is quite probable that no work will be undertaken towards the individual project during the mid-year recess. This is due to the need to prepare for and attend RoboCup 2015, China. It has therefore been omitted from the schedule.

	\section{Ethical issues} {
	\label{sec:ethical_issues}
		
		The data used to model the visualisations have the potential to lead to ethical issues by containing personal data or copyrighted information.
		
		\subsection{Personal data} {
		\label{sec:personal_data}
		
			Personal data is information that is able to identify a person and could be obtained when this project is integrated with the final year group project. It is necessary to log user information in order to obtain the data required to display the visualisations. Users must:
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Remain informed of how the data is stored, preserved and used. 
				\item Consent to the storage of this information.
				\item Be informed of how confidentiality will be maintained.
			\end{itemize}
			
			The research data should be anonymised, to increase confidentiality, so individuals cannot be identified from the data. This can be achieved by recording different users with an arbitrary value such as a colour or unique identifier, instead of their name or student number. It is also feasible to not record this data at all and simply just store the values associated with their touches.
		
		}
		
		\subsection{Copyrighted information} {
		\label{sec:copyright}
		
			This poses as an issue when the data used for the visualisation is extracted from an external source. The data should be under a public copyright licence to ensure that there are no copyright infringements when applying it to the project.
			
			A possible solution to this issue is to instead generate fake data. This will see the benefit of viewing the visualisation under a large dataset, removing any concern over copyright issues. However, the visualisation will not display real information and the generated data may appear too random. This data could be generated within a program or by using free online tools.
