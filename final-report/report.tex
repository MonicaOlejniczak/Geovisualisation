	% It has been demonstrated that there are many interesting ways to visualise geographical data with various datasets in this chapter. It is essential to consider the design of the geovisualisations in regards to how they can be visualised and applied to different datasets. As such, the next chapter will explore the design of the system and the software methodology utilised throughout the development of this project.

	% In conclusion, this chapter has captured the design of the system in great detail. The implementation specific technologies should first be investigated before examining the implementation details of this project. These technologies have been specified in the next chapter.

	% \chapter{Technologies} {
	% \label{ch:technologies}
	% 	\input{chapters/technologies}

	% The implementation details can now be explored in the next chapter, since the project design and technologies have been established in the previous chapters.

	The role of system evaluation is crucial for measuring the usability and performance of the system, which can be used to determine the success of the system. These details have been examined in the next chapter.
