\begin{gather*}
	x = r\sin\phi\sin\theta \\
	y = r\cos\phi \\
	z = r\sin\phi\cos\theta
\end{gather*}

where $r$ is the radial distance of the camera from the origin, $\phi$ is the polar angle calculated by adding the delta phi angle with the angle from the y-axis and $\theta$ is the azimuthal angle which is calculated by adding the delta theta angle with the angle from the z-axis around the y-axis.
